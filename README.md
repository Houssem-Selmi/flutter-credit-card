# About the project 
This project contains the source code of a Flutter [Tutorial](https://medium.com/@selmi.hussem/practice-flutter-layout-concepts-by-creating-a-credit-card-widget-tutorial-1fbc8a9e36e) elaborated to practice Flutter basic layout concepts by creating a credit card widget.

In this [Tutorial](https://medium.com/@selmi.hussem/practice-flutter-layout-concepts-by-creating-a-credit-card-widget-tutorial-1fbc8a9e36e), we are going to diagram the layout to identify the Flutter widgets that we will use.
